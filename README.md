# MIPS Iterative Quicksort with Insertion

This is a sorting algorithm implemented in MIPS assembly as a University assignment.

These are some nice references we used:<br>

**Warning:** Ugly code. We prioritized optimization since this was a competition, so all subroutines have been inlined, and register conventions have been ignored.
